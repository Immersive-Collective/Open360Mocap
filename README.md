# Open360Mocap

Open360Mocap is an open-source framework for accurate and robust full-body motion capture. By combining affordable IMU sensors with a single 360° camera, Open360Mocap bridges the gap between robust body tracking and global spatial anchoring for XR, animation, and research applications.

## Features

- Hybrid IMU + 360° visual-inertial motion capture
- Global position anchoring with minimal drift
- Low-cost, modular, and hardware-agnostic
- Real-time tracking for VR/AR/XR applications
- Open for community contributions

## How It Works

Open360Mocap fuses data from wearable IMU sensors (for joint orientation and fast motion) with a single 360-degree camera (mounted on top of the head or helmet). The 360 camera provides a global spatial anchor by matching environmental features, which is combined with inertial estimates to provide drift-free, full-body motion tracking—even in challenging, occluded, or crowded environments.

## Use Cases

- Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR)
- Live performance and telepresence
- Animation and game development
- Research in biomechanics and movement science
